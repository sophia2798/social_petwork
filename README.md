This application allows users to find local pets and schedule meetups with follow pet owners. The user can create an account by providing their full name, email, password, and zip code.

Then, the user can visit the "Petwork" page to view local pets in the same area code. From there, they can contact the pet's owner and/or favorite the pet. "Favorited" pets can be viewed from the user's "Favorite's" page at any time. The user is also able to edit their information and their pets' information at any time.
